Additonal features to be required:


Version 1.0 :

The game looks well-structured and functional. It uses a simple approach to randomly select a word from a predefined list and allows the play to guess letters. But it need some enhancement such that:
a)Clearer Instructions : Add more instructions to guide the user, especially if they are unfamiliar with the rules of Hangman.
b)Visual representation of Hangman : Include a visual representation of the Hangman as a feedback mechanism for the user.

Version 1.1 :

Additional features to be required:

In this version, the game doesn't visually represent the number of remaining attempts. You could add a simple graphical representation of the hangman. For ex: drawing different parts of the hangman for each incorrect guess. Also can implement a scoring system by keeping track of the user's score based on the number of attempts taken to guess the word. This adds a competitive element of the game.

Version 1.2: Overall, this Hangman game is efficient and user friendly. But it still needs to add some more exciting features.

1.Add a timer : Introduce a timer to limit the time for each guess, making the game more exciting.
2.Scoreboard: Add a score board simultaneously while playing a game.
3.Level: Approach for easy to intermediate to hard levels for the game.
